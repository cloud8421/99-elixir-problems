==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloud8421/99-elixir-problems.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloud8421/99-elixir-problems)

Solutions for the [99 Prolog problems exercise](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) in Elixir.

Exercises are solved as tests, so to check that they work it's enough to run `mix test`.
